This is the code repository for 2018 Python Regular Expressions - Real World Projects [Video](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/2018-python-regular-expressions-real-world-projects-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Welcome to Python Regular Expressions Course! You will apply your new skills with four hands-on real-world projects. You will gain solid understanding on type of performance issues regex can run into, and techniques to address them. As part of resources in this course, you will get a high-quality quick reference guide, an interactive tool, all the source code and downloadable slides. Why Learn Regular Expressions? Very often, the data that we need is not readily accessible or useful. Data preparation and clean-up is often one of the most time-consuming activities in a software automation project. Instead of spending time writing code for all this, you can specify data patterns of interest and let regular expression engine do the work for you. Regular Expression is cross-platform and you can learn the concepts once and use it in multiple programming languages and environment
Looking forward to seeing you in the course! God Speed!
